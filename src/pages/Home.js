        I'm Heidi, the girl behind this website. I'm an Estonian, who's been living in 5 different countries
        <br></br> and visited 25 countries so far.

        I started this travel blog in 2024 to document my own international trips, share my photos,

        <br></br>and help others learn how to travel the world

        and find some really good spots off the beaten path.<br></br>

        I'm currently based in Tallinn, Estonia with my family, my husband and my son. <br></br>

        Together, we've done some bucket list hikes, seen exotic wildlife, and visited some spectacular castles, temples,

        <br></br>and monuments around the world.<br></br>

        I haven’t been everywhere, but it’s on my list. I hope this world travel blog can help and

        <br></br>inspire you in your own journeys as well!
